# Windows Setup

Install VS Code using `winget`:

```powershell
winget install -e --id Microsoft.VisualStudioCode
```

Additionally, install the following applications to enhance usability (not directly related to development):

- **Microsoft PowerToys**: Install via the Microsoft Store for various productivity utilities.
- **[Window Switcher](https://github.com/sigoden/window-switcher)**: Allows switching between windows of the same application.

Remap **Caps Lock** to **Left Ctrl** using PowerToys.

Save the [window-switcher.ini](./window-switcher.ini) file in the same directory as `window-switcher.exe`.
